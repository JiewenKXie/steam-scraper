					Besides the low multiplayer population, this game is excellent!  The artistic design is done by Weta, the same studio that did prop design for the Lord of the Rings movies.  The music is by Frank Klepacki, the same guy who made the music for the Command and Conquer series.  Petroglyph, the company that produced the game, is also made up of a lot of ex-Westwood employees who formed Petroglyph after EA dissolved Westwood.  Tbh, I prefer the storyline and gameplay to Starcraft 2's."

					It's good, not sure it's full price good, but it's good. Price point should have been closer to 39.00. Solid C&C style RTS. I like that the units don't have special powers that have to be kept up with. (why I suck so bad at SC2)"

					Never written a review for steam before, but wanted to express how much I have enjoyed this game so for. Grew up playing the old school RTS, Warcraft, Warcraft2, Starcraft, Age of Empire's 1 & 2 and everything in between. As time has progressed I have always felt that the RTS genre was dying with the exception of Starcraft 2. Love the game, a solid testiment to the older RTS style. Players that grew up with Starcraft 2 maybe be frustrated at the slower pace, but anyone that grew up in the hay day of RTS will love it.					"

					One of the best RTS in recent years. Each faction has its unique features and can provide unique experience. Combats are slower than SC2 and a good strategy is much more important than micromanagement. The optimization should be improved when there are a lot of units in the screen. Highly recommend to all RTS fans!"

					It's refreshing to see an RTS that finally goes back to the genre's roots as well as adding interesting mechanics that feel right. The base building mechanics, units, and technologies for each race are completely unique but gameplay still feels balanced. As a huge fan of the classic C&C's, it's awesome that the soundtrack is composed by the man himself Frank Klepacki. Not only that but having former talent from Westwood working on this game, you really can't go wrong.					"

					Grey Goo does a ton right when it comes to RTS games, long have I wanted a proper base building type RTS. With wickedly different factions and a great soundtrack all while looking fantastic.

					If you enjoy SC2 ladder play, and are looking for something new, I highly recommend this game. Given the small developer, it's amazingly close to Starcraft2 level quality. Visuals are awesome once you get contrast/gamma tuned up. Multiplayer ladder is very engaging. Cheese exists, as do cheese counters. As a novice, gameplay seems a bit slower and more positionally strategic compared to SC2, though there is certainly room for micro APM to make a huge difference. There are a few ""first release"" bugs, but pretty minimal and as-expected. Windowed-Fullscreen works well. Steam shift-Tab chat stuff is a little clunky compared to "

					As a huge fan of Age of Empires I had great expectations of this game, and they were met over and over again! This is a great RTS game and an amazing story line in the campaign! I cant get enough of the campagins story and they just added DLC expansion of the campaign which I am enjoying very much! Such a great game I am very happy with my purchase totally worth the price paid! If you like age of empires and are looking for a new twist on the same type of game you will enjoy this game. The multiplayer had a ruff start but they have since fixed this by having exclusive servers now and making an observer mode as well as replay ability. So I give the game 10 outta 10!					"

					You know, I'm a huge RTS fan. Played every warcraft, red alert c&c you could think of and this is just bleh. It isn't interesting, it isn't difficult, it feels like an introduction to RTS games for children before they play the decade old starcraft. This game is behind SC2 somehow. I cannot believe I allowed good reviews to convince me this was good.					"

					This game is a very good RTS. If you have been looking for a new RTS outside the box of SC2 and more to a CnC way this is for you. The Factions are great to play as. Now some mecahnics are new but with that new comes a new challenge and new ways to play the game. The Campaign is fun, 5 Missions per faction but they have depth. The multiplayer is what you would expect for a RTS way too many people playing one Faction till people found a good counter so hang in there for that. Also the cinematics are amazing! I highly recommend this game and encourage people to play and fun!					"

					(Alpha review) Multiplayer is just about dead, there's very few people online (under 100 people a day online according to steam) and if you happen to connect to one you will experience severe stuttering and lag issues making it unplayable until the point you disconnect. Additionally both singleplayer and multiplayer have stuttering (units freezing/catchup) when my systems fps is over 60 and cpu isn't hitting max (perhaps a code issue)."

					For all the players who want to taste an old school RTS like Emperor Battle for Dune or Command and Conquer, Grey Goo is a must. The game is not so long in history mode but with the bonus goals and the hard difficulty level then I assure you that you will spent some good hours playing. The last time I played a RTS in multiplayer mode was Starcraft 1 a lot of years ago and I started again with this game. I do not have performance issues with this game and my pc is quite ordinary (I read some reviews saying that some people had problems with this).					"

					This game is great. I've already spent 150 hrs. playing it. If you like RTSs but don't like the level of micro required to play Starcraft 2 well you will love this game. It simplifies a few annoying things about Starcraft without taking away any control. I like how you can rebuild extractors very quickly so it isn't too devastating to destroy them. You actually have to control ground on the map instead of just running around the map doing hit and runs on buildings."

					Maybe Its just that I havent played an RTS in a long time but damn the AI in this can be a challenge. Anyways, the game is beautifully rendered, the models used in briefings and cutscenes are incredible, they almost look like people in makeup rather than CGI and the voices are quite good (although the heavy Australian(?) accent for the Beta's was quite a shock to get used to). Definately a good game.					"

					If you enjoy a slightly slower paced RTS where you don't need god like reflexes to be number one and actually planning and macro mean a lot more this is the game for you. This game deserves far more attention then its getting and if i hadn't looked at the developer i would have mistaken it for a AAA company for sure. As the others have mentioned the downsides are they low number of maps and small campaign but with the map editor at least one of those should be a non issue relatively soon. If your looking for a super amazing story you won't find it here. That's not to say its not good but it certainly lacks the universe a game like SC has to draw from. Give this game a shot you definetly will not regret it.					"

					I like it, the game starts off very slow paced, but once you have gotten all the units unlocked and figure out the resource system (simplified version of supreme commanders) it's a lot of fun. Grey goo is more of a base building focused rts than combat focused, so those of you who enjoyed command and conquer will like this. It also has nice graphics and unit and building animations.					"

Also surprisingly difficult with each race having their own learning curve and ultimate unit for epic ♥♥♥ fights.					"

					Great game.  Easily the best RTS I've ever played, right up there with starcraft 2 and supreme commander 2.  The main part that makes this game unique is the races.  The beta have a regular building system that requires power.  The humans for once are a futuristic type of race whereas in almost every other RTS they are behind the other races.  The Beta are the onces with the regular tanks, and machine guns, and the sorts.  The goo is the most unique thing I've ever seen.  Instead of using buildings or turrets the goo is just one huge mass of goo.  The units are spawned from mother goos and is just incredibly unique.  100/100 easily.					"

Each race plays differently enough to give you a slightly different experiance. If you're a fan of the RTS genre and looking scratch that old school itch, buy it. If you're a fan of RTS but aren't sure about this title, wait for a sale.					"

					Grey Goo is an unusal RTS gem from the studio Petroglyph, makers of Star Wars Empire at War. Playing much more like a C&C game of ages past than the usual starcraft clone, GG has 3 factions that are centered less around micromanaging and more around tactics and war. Wether you want to LITERALLY eat your enemies as the Goo, turtle as the betas, or play as the enigmatic humans, this is the game for you.					"

					Nearly 30 hours into the multiplayer so far. Grey Goo is an incredible addition to modern RTS, the kind of sloppy a-click gameplay that other RTS games fall victim to is heavily punished by any competent player. Even in casual matches I find tons of new strategies and the game deepens with every match I play. The only downside is the performance and lack of replays, which are huge drawbacks, but if you lower your settings and suck it up you will find much to enjoy - and hopefully with time those issues with dwindle.

					Great game for classic RTS fans.  Interesting game mechanics.  Story is short, but serves its purpose - to be a tutorial for new players to learn how to get a base up and running as well as how the units work.  Some might be put off by the $50 price tag, but kickstarter-free game development is expensive, and they paid for it out of pocket.  This is one of the best RTS games to show up since Starcraft 2.					"

					Having a lot of fun with this title. The campaign is really quite fun and does a great job of easing the player into the game. It teaches you how to use all the units etc. Multiplayer is fun too, only problem is when your a noob and your teammates bounces at the start of the match. Overall, I would give it a 4/5 its really enjoyable and great to switch it up coming from a more fps type game player.					"

					A throw-back RTS with some really nice factions that bring new ideas and play into the genre. The goo is very unique faction, and the beta and humans are both fun. While relatively simple, it has enough layers to keep gameplay enjoyable. With a little balance (Artillery seems a bit strong right now), it could really shine. Give it a chance, and you might be impressed if an old school RTS is what you want.					"

					Grey Goo is, in my opinion, an absolutely incredible rts,  the races within it are diverse and different from one another and each has their own completely unique styles of game-play,  while the multi-player servers do feel empty nowadays i can safely say that each game is well worth the wait.  with a unique style and a really kind and inviting player-base (while it may be small it is by far one of the nicest groups of players iv'e had the pleasure of joining)  All and all, a really amazing, fun, and unique game with addicting, fun and all around enjoyable gameplay that wont completely repel a new player makes me happy to recommend the game to anyone looking for an RTS					"

					Could beat multiple hard AI as the Goo within 7.5 hours. Despite user reviews of the game playing similarly to old-school Command and Conquer and AoE III, still reminded me completely of Starcraft II. I really can't say if the game is good or not, but from what I've so far experienced, despite what I mentioned earlier, I would still recommend Grey Goo.					"

					The developers have put a lot of work into the campaign and the graphics, voice actors, and concept is really interesting. That being said, the mechanics are what you'd expect from a 90's RTS.  I always enjoyed playing Red Alert and Warcraft so I thought it would be great change of pace from some of the faster paced modern ones, turns out not really. I tried to like the game, played a couple campaign missions and a skirmish. Within the two hours I had it, it really felt like I understood all that the game had to offer.					"

					This game is a complete disappointment.  The multi-player is broken so if you are buying the game to play with your friends just STOP right now.  You will spend more time trying to fix this game then you will playing it.  Once in the game (if you can get past the launcher) you will begin to understand after the first few misisons that the game has nothing to do with strategy and everything to do with who can build the most units and blindly march them around the map.  Build 3 large factories and then mass produce any tank = win in every situation no matter what.  Save your money."

					If you are a game collector, wait for a sale.  If you are a hardcore gamer - this game is a little disappointing.  Nice story line, but gameplay mechanics could do with some improvements.  Lots of micro managing which really takes the fun out of RTS. When you play the Goo be prepared to super micro manage - if you are being attacked from multiple fronts you will probably lose because you need to micro manage the combat as well - which is sad.

					This is a great RTS. A very refreshing resource management system. This game does a lot of things right that other RTSs don't. I don't have that instinct to turtle like in most RTS games.

					I went into this with some decent opinions and reviews.  And it was woefully underestimated.  This is an amazing RTS, reminds me a lot of StarCraft, with its own unique storyline and seriously addictive gameplay.  Highly recommended.  Seriously, buy this game.  Probably one of my favorite purchases in recent memory if you enjoy RTS, and what appears to be high budget.					"

					A generally good game, however, the skirmish AI difficulty settings seem meaningless. Hard AI's routinely get wiped out by Easy AI's, while occasionally a medium AI will just sit there and do nothing. While the settings for defensive, offensive, etc seem to have some bearing, an AI set to ""balanced"" will assault you with relentless waves of enemies such that they are indistinguishable from an AI set to ""offensive."" In team skirmish mode, your ally AI will rarely if ever assist or cooperate with you, while the team enemy AI's will coordinate exceptionally well, even when set to ""Easy."" I lost my first dozen or so matches against an ""easy"" AI because it was so brutally aggressive.					"

					This game does things really well, and then does other things really bad. I was giving it the benefit of the doubt that it was going to get better but the mission Crash Site is broken, poorly designed, and just not fun. Wasted an hour on this mission because I wanted to complete it and move on and it's impossible to complete. The game gets pacing wrong, difficulty wrong, and doesn't respect the players time. It's too bad because I really wanted to play a new great RTS. If you have the patience, this might be your game.					"

I have an alienware and it constantly stutters and has graphical corruption despite altering a lot of settings to get it to just run at all.

					This game was a waste of money. MAYBE worth it if it was $10. I spent $50 and can't even play. There are major issues with FPS when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. I have a high end gaming desktop and there is no reason my game should lag. Waited for patches to fix the frame rate issue and they never came. The game itself is OK. nothing special. would avoid until it comes down in price BIG time.					"

					Good fun!  There hasn't been an RTS that has caught my eye in long while.  I thought I'd give this a go, and I'm glad I did.  The game play is solid.    At first, I felt the simplistic build order would dull the game, after the first few rounds, I realized the it gave me more time to concentrate on my strategy.  I really enjoy the fact that there are multiple way in which to win each map.  The AI is also good at changing things up each time you play it.

					Very, Very fun. Relitivelly simple, but with a depth of complexity that most RTS games never get. I have rarely come across the idea of self-replicating machinery: at least, von-neumann machines that you can PLAY as. It is... Different, and inspiring. I feel sorry for the goo- created, then forgotten... and they are one of the most interesting enemies to play as. Ever. "

					Awesome RTS game.  Maybe not as good and Total Annihilation/Supreme Commander but still very enjoyable.  Maps max out at 4 players which is ok at first but quickly find myself wanting larger maps for 6-8 players.  Hopefully I can find some custom maps that wil fill this void.  Also this game is expensive at $50 and would be a much better buy at $30 or 4 copies for $100.  Regardless of those negatives I'm still very pleased with the purchase and would buy again.					"

The campagin wasn't half bad but I felt like at times the AI was a bit buggy and didn't function correctly, which in turn made things kinda easy at times ( though I did play through on normal so this might be incorrect, I need to test out the multiplayer a bit).

The game mechanics are reasonably simple however this also contributes to the games major short coming that the units have no depth.

					Smart AI compared to other RTS games. The people in the cutscenes look very real. I thought they were real people at first. The combat is more simple than other RTS games but it is more enjoyable. I wish the single player campaign was longer and the story more complex. I hope they add new missions as DLC to flesh out the story. The Goo are a very unique enemy type.

					Great for a classic RTS lover. Each faction gives its own style of play. Grey goo also has a pretty good single player which is great. My only complaint will be the unit cap of 200.

					Played this for one of the play for free weekends and just finished. I like the story quite a bit, and I think it is one reason why you should play the game. However I don't see how you could sink hundreds of hours into it. Looking at the price regular it is steep. I'd say no less then $20 for the game which is what is on sale at the moment. Good game though, diverse races, each having their strengths. Also each one has their own UI's which is a nice touch. Personally I like the Beta due to being able to drop down anywhere on the map.					"

					I've been playing this during the free preview and was most definitely impressed. Doesn't deserve the ""mixed"" rating. Great for casual RTS fans. Really clean looking/running and not overly complicated like StarCraft. The story seems great, and the animation good quality as well. Kind of remidns me of old FMV games the way they narrate between missions, but done correctly."

					Recenlty bought this game when it was on sale. The game is just amazing and extremly underestimated. I've come to the conclusion that the only reason why this game isn't more popular then it already is might be because people simply hasn't heard about it or have just watched some clips and not tried it. The game is so much better then the videos and the marketing are showing. The campaign is so much better that SC2 campaign in my opinion and the story is just amazing. Great job devs!					"

					The lack of depth really kills this game for me. At first I was surprised by how different the factions' tech trees were. The base building system is something new  - every faction has different ways to build their bases and I love it. BUT units are boring. all races (well, except the goo) have pretty much the same units and only 2 structures for unit training. Mix that with lack of unit abilities (like grenades or barages) and you have a repetetive experience. This is a decent RTS, but it's far from excellent one.					"

					A MUST HAVE for Diehard strategy games fans. Loved Command and Conquer? You'll love this. You loved Homeworld? You'll love this! With nicely balanced mechanics and factions, the three races each have unique playstyles and tactics making for colourful and event filled matches instead of short firefights. The Beta are your classic strategy genre, yet with the twist of needing defenable ""Hubs"". Humans need to keep thier base powered and compact and Goo dont have a base but morph themselves into what is required! Truly innovative gameplay from the some of the fantastic fellas from Westwood. 100% Reccommended!					"

					Would I recommend this game to people? Yes. Would I Recommend it to Timmy the 8 year old thats played Starcraft and think all strategy games are the same? NO. This game was by no definition; EASY. It was fantastic graphics wise, balancing wise, and even min/max wise. But the thing that SUCKED the joy out of this game was the resource management. The fact that you go BANKRUPT inside of 15-30 minutes, for a SLOW paced strategy game; made me want to tear my eyes out on NORMAL AI modes. Let alone Hard or Expert. All in all, 8/10, But not for the CRAPPY strategists. You NEED to be good at what you're doing to truly enjoy this game.					"

					This game is a stunner. The classic RTS mechanics combined with that old time feel and narrowed maps almost garuantees you a good time thru every replay. The Goo itself is by far the toughest faction to play, as the Beta are the easiest.  This game rates 5 stars in my opinion. Good job guys looking forward to seeing what you do with Dreadnaught.

					After being super hyped for End of Nations, and then it getting cancelled, it's so nice to finally have another game from these guys. I couldn't have asked for more. Being a long time RTS fan, I felt right at home the moment I started playing this. And yet, it still manages to be unique. Base building for each of the three factions feels completely different to any RTS I've played in the past, and they're different to each other as well. An excellent example of staying traditional while moving forward. Highly recommended for any traditional RTS fan.					"

					So I normally do not do a review on games but it amazes me how many people recommend this game.  I bought it based on the pc gamer review.  The sad thing is the game limits you to 200 units and you can only play up to 2 v 2.  So if you like to play the campaigns against a computer then this is for you but otherwise stay away.  Also the game will crash on a 2 v 2 game so I am not sure if it can really handle it.					"

					Sorry to have to down rate this game due to fact that production of everything is so slow, if the game was more fast paced it would be more enjoyable in my opinion. Also that I find annoying is that to build defense turrets you have to build a combination of buildings together to produce them which makes it hard to properly defend your base in the beginning of given map. Other than that, the game looks really nice; alot of time went in to make it look good. I just wish they spent more time on the mechanics.					"

Firts off: For the graphics options I chose, the graphics I saw and the pc I own the FPS were far too low. But who cares, I thought...the game itself is quite fun, I think, somehow. However it takes decades to load a campaign mission and after the game tried to screw with me by telling me to ""click here to start"" and then not doing anything I decided this is going back to were it belongs.

					While the graphics are beautiful and the game itself is really nice to play, the biggest problem and quite laughably is the load time between missions and mission restarts. I have a high end gaming rig and a 2 minute+ load screen is bizarre, a couple of times i thought my PC had frozen but, no, it was still loading. This really is the off putting reason not to buy this game. Luckily i bought it in the 60% discount sale and didnt waste too much money on it.  I reached mission 3 and i believe it will remain there till i forget how long the load times are and dive back in, to then jump back out. I am shocked that a game has been placed on sale with this load lag problem.					"

					Boo. This game is buggy as all get out. It needs some serious work before it's ready for prime time. The three factions are well balanced but have very limited variety very similar units. Base building is ok and some of the defenses are interesting but none of that outweighs the fact that this game was released before the bugs were worked out so you'll effectively be paying to beta test for the developers.

					I'm trying to like it, but I can't.  Steep learning curve is a massive understatement.  Maybe I'm just not liking the starting race in the campaign, but the tech progression is a bit wonky and the tutorial is clear as mud.  Seems like the only way to get anywhere is by tank rushing over and over and over and over while the enemy tank rushes you over and over and over and over.  Your troops move with all the intelligence they did in Warcraft I.  I guess the focus is on macro instead of micro management, but I just can't click with it.  I'm sad, because the cutscenes are a great throwback to RTS games of old.  I'll keep trying.					"

The units all fire the same type of projectile either multipule times or single shot for all races (with exception of the Super Units).

					Once again I am fooled by reviews I was hoping for a game comparable to supreme commander  or something with at least that type of creative element sadly however this game is neither its just another cc or sc clone ZERG FEST. some of the game is well made but your troops are just well blind and stupid I guess. there is absolutely  nothing here that warrants the 50 dollar cost save your money for now maybe pick it up on sale for under 15 bucks that way you wont have buyers remorse. I have to point out that I only played the campaign and multiplayer might be more fun if your into that type of thing.					"

					While Beta and Humans have good range of attack and many units shoot when move, for Goo it shows all the fail of game. Unit movement AI is very poor. Notifications that units under attack not shown on map. Micromanagement amount for goo is overhelming (while for Beta and Humans u can hide under defences and build your force)."

					Great cinematics and strong story but gameplay is a grind. Structures are too strong and your units are too weak and dumb. You can spend 10 minutes building a force and see it wiped in 20 seconds. Given how long the build times are the units should be stronger. Towers are way too strong.

					In this time of complete absence of traditional, well-polished RTS titles on the market, Grey Goo feels like a breath of fresh air. Following the classic C&C formula, it offers a welcome distraction from the more fast-paced, micromanagement-oriented games like COH and StarCraft. The campaign is actually pretty good, the story has a feel of a literary sci-fi novel to it. I like the interesting twist in faction design, with the humans being more high-tech and alien than the aliens themselves. The third faction, the Goo, is unlike any faction I've seen in any other RTS, and plays very differently compared to the other two. And of course, it wouldn't be a worthy successor to the C&C franchise if the soundtrack wasn't composed by Frank Klepacki. I definitely recommend this game to any C&C fan out there!					"

					A great new addition to a genre that really needs a reboot. I enjoyed playing the campaign. A great throwback to those Westwood games where you play just to see the next cutseen. I even enjoyed the story, though don't expect Shakespeare. The races feel sufficiently unique, though similar, for the campaign to stay fresh.					"

					ver fun game! i would really recommend it, but it is quite hard. i dont play too many strategy games, so maybe its not compared to some, and before you start sometimes you get the feeling, can i be botherd to do this? you really have to try. but when your in it you cant stop, you NEED to win, and you feel so immersed, because the graphics and cut scenes are amazing. buy the game! (but wait untill its on sale)					"

					5 hours in;  good time to start a review?  Well I'm hooked;  this RTS has every aspect of C&C plus the new base development system.  It makes the joy of building a base round the original spawning point (taking into account the near-by resource areas, whilst keeping an eye on the open doors (can be secured by towers) to your new home) even more of a joy than it was before.  The engine behaves as you would expect it too with basically the same controls as (the aformentioned) C&C.  But the cut sequences, oh the cut sequences, they are a of a different class. *at the time of writing, the story is also getting quite gripping.  Can't wait to see what's next...					"

					The game itself is good.  I've really miss the old style RTS games.  I like how each race has their own different ways of producing units.  Its confusing at first.  But as you progress in the game, you learn how to make the units.  The maps are mid size, I wish they have a bigger map.   The air units are terrible.. they can only hit once then have to go back and refuel... .   Sometimes the maps are very confusing with the terriains.   And why is everything soo freaking DARK in this game..  even with the gamma all the way up, its still DARK!  "

					Interesting concepts that I have never before seen in an RTS. I have played a lot of them. Very enjoyable. The tech tree is especially interesting. Since picking a tech denies two others. So you have to plan ahead when picking your technology, using it to counter your opponent. The tech may be re-specced during the game, but takes three minutes to do. Play it your way.					"

					A game that reminds me an awful lot like C&C. There are 3 seperate factions with completely different play styles. Humans play a more defence play, Beta play an offensive play and the Goo are very different in respect to anything I have played before. This game is all about that early game and knowing what your enemy is doing. Building a billion of one unit doesn't work like it did in C&C and so you must build counters. Overall I really enjoy this game and I would reccomend andyone to pick this game up on sale.					"

					I originally had some problems with poor pathing, but since I only saw it the one time I must assume the first instance was just a random fluke.  This is a pretty good entry into the RTS genre; in particular I've never seen a race that functions entirely without base structures like the goo does.  A very original concept there, and well executed.					"

					The building is too limited and the mechanic is way too easy. I played as human and all I build was light unit and won the game !					"

					I bought this game on preorder and loved the campaign straight up, I finished it in a solid weekend. The multiplayer took some time but I think they have it about right now. Even thought it released 8 months ago the devs are still constantly taking input on it and making changes. Plus the tournament has been awesome so far. Warning this game is about macro and is slower paced then that other popular RTS. If you can't do without twitch MP and tons of micro this is probably not the game for you."

					This is a very enjoyable game. If you like fast paced RTS games without having to constantly be doing micromanagement, then I'd absolutely suggest this game for you. It is a fresh take on a fantastic game genre. Very well done!					"

					Refreshing! I love the asymetrical factions. Each one plays differently and is quite difficult to master. The campain is wonderfully crafted. It makes the player understand little by little how to use each faction's unique properties in different situations. Also, both the story and the lore are fascinating. This game deserves much more praise and visibility than it currently has. Compared to say, Starcraft, it is a bit slower and more macro-management intensive, kinda like Supreme Commander.					"

					A welcome return to form for the RTS genre.  It's just a shame that a game-breaking crash takes place mission 3 which prevents me from completing it."

					Just finished the campaign and enjoyed the game enormously. Has been a while since I enjoyed an RTS this much, and I missed. I look forward to learning to play it better and would recommend it to anybody who has once enjoyed an RTS. :)					"

					Grey Goo has an interesting story line and stunning visuals. gameplay takes a midrange learning curve. The campaign  is entertaining but I would say it has low replayability. This is on the same level as Starcraft except the goo is relatively weak - overall I would wait for this game to go on special before buying. I was disappointed overall - would have liked to see a more intense storyline.					"

					This game is beautiful and runs great.  It was so much potential to be great, too bad the story in the campaign is so boring.  Why they decided to make these inspired cutscenes with awesome VA work; and NO STORY.  The story of this game is never properly explained, you are just thrust into the middle of it with hopes you will understand it.  I keep wanting to like this game, but I still haven't found a way to do that effectively.					"
